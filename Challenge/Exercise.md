table.insert(player.inventory, "Magic Sword")

player.gold = player.gold + 50

```



## Steps to Complete

1. Initialize player table with inventory and gold

2. Add the "Magic Sword" to inventory

3. Increase gold by 50

4. Print the updated player state



## Expected Output

```

Inventory: Magic Sword

Gold: 50

```



## Next Steps

In Day 3, we'll explore:

- Player movement choices (left/right)

- Conditional logic with if/else

- Room encounters and game flow
